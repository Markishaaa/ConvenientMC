# ConvenientMC Spigot Plugin

ConvenientMC is a Spigot plugin designed to enhance the convenience of gameplay in Minecraft. It introduces several features that modify existing mechanics or introduce new crafting recipes to make the player's experience more enjoyable.

## Compatibility

ConvenientMC is designed for Minecraft version 1.20.4.

## Features

### 1. Stripped Log Crafting
Craft stripped logs effortlessly by placing your axe and unstripped logs in a crafting area. The plugin calculates durability, considering enchantments like Unbreaking, and subtracts the appropriate amount of durability from the axe.

### 2. More Yield in Crafting Recipes
Increase the yield for various crafting recipes, such as:
- Wooden stairs (now gives 6 instead of 4)
- Wooden trapdoors (now gives 4 instead of 2)
- All buttons (now gives 4 instead of 1)

### 3. New Crafting Recipes
Discover new crafting possibilities, including:
- Turning clay and snow blocks into clay and snowballs
- Converting wool into 4 strings
- Combining 4 mangrove roots to obtain 2 mangrove logs

### 4. Modified Enchantments
Enable the addition of "looting" to a trident exclusively through an anvil.
